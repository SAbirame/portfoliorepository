      <h2>PROJECT 1: 3D SHAPES</h2>
      <p>The code seems well-structured with clear section divisions. The use of flex containers for layout is a good practice as it allows for responsive design. The combination of custom fonts from Google Fonts and FontAwesome icons adds visual appeal to the webpage. The hover effects on the navigation menu items provide interactivity to the user interface. The color scheme is consistent and visually appealing.

      <h2>PROJECT 2: XTRA BLOG</h2>
      <p>In my project, I've leveraged CSS Grid Layout to create a well-structured grid-based layout. By specifying columns and rows, I've positioned elements precisely and achieved a visually appealing design. The grid's responsiveness ensures my layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and devices.</p>

      <p>A landing page is a standalone web page specifically designed to achieve a single objective, often centered around conversion. It serves as an entry point for users, guiding them towards a specific action, such as signing up, downloading, purchasing, or contacting. </p>
